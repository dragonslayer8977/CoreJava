process: an independently running program
    - process is isolated from other processes.
    - has it's own memory
thread: a lightweight unit of this independently running program(process)
    - runs simultaneously along with other threads
    - access the shared memory of the process

1. new: Thread object created but not started (new Thread())

2. Runnable: Thread is ready but waiting for resources (start())

3. Running: Thread is actually running(i.e., executing) meaning resources has been allocated to the thread since CPU scheduler picked that thread

4. Waiting: Thread runs indefinitely until other thread notifies it using notify(), notifyAll()

5. Timed waiting: Thread waits for a specific period of time (sleep(), join(), wait())

6. Blocked: Thread will be in blocked state when it is trying to acquire a lock (currently acquired by other thread)

7. Terminated: Thread is said to be terminated if it completes it's execution or there is an occurrence of an unhandled exception or error



Methods in Thread class

- start(): starts the new thread of execution(internally calls run() method)
- run(): the code that the thread executes(). calling this method directly does not create a thread, just executes like a normal method call
- join(): makes the thread wait until other thread is executed(i.e., terminated)
- sleep(): pauses the thread execution for a given period of time
- interrupt(): interrupts a thread in waiting or sleeping state, sets the interrupt call
- isAlive(): checks the running status of the thread("true" if thread is started and "false" if the thread is terminated)
- getName(): returns the name of the thread
- setName(): sets the name of the thread
- getPriority(): gets the priority of the thread
- setPriority(): sets the priority of the thread (min_priority: 1 to max_priority: 10)
- currentThread(): returns a reference to the currently running thread
- getState(): returns the current state of the thread (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED)
- holdsLock(Object obj): checks if the current thread holds a lock on the given object
- yield(): temporarily pause the execution of the current thread to allow for other threads to execute
