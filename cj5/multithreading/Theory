process: an independently running program
    - process is isolated from other processes.
    - has it's own memory
thread: a lightweight unit of this independently running program(process)
    - runs simultaneously along with other threads
    - access the shared memory of the process
lock(object's monitor): a lock is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access the shared resources at any give time, this prevents data inconsistency
thread starving: a condition where the thread is in runnable state, but waits for resources indefinitely because higher priority thread use those resources.
deadlock: a condition where the threads wait for resources indefinitely. below four conditions must be true for a deadlock to occur
    - only one thread can use the resource at a time
    - a thread is holding resource and waiting for remaining resources which are held by other thread
    - resources cannot be taken away from a long running thread by force
    - a chain of threads where one thread holds some resources and is waiting for another threads to release those resource and
      this forms a cycle where no thread releases their resources and waits indefinitely

1. new: Thread object created but not started (new Thread())

2. Runnable: Thread is ready but waiting for resources (start())

3. Running: Thread is actually running(i.e., executing) meaning resources has been allocated to the thread since CPU scheduler picked that thread

4. Waiting: Thread runs indefinitely until other thread notifies it using notify(), notifyAll()

5. Timed waiting: Thread waits for a specific period of time (sleep(), join(), wait())

6. Blocked: Thread will be in blocked state when it is trying to acquire a lock (currently acquired by other thread)

7. Terminated: Thread is said to be terminated if it completes it's execution or there is an occurrence of an unhandled exception or error



Methods in Thread class

- start(): starts the new thread of execution(internally calls run() method)
- run(): the code that the thread executes(). calling this method directly does not create a thread, just executes like a normal method call
- join(): makes the thread wait until other thread is executed(i.e., terminated)
- sleep(): pauses the thread execution for a given period of time
- interrupt(): interrupts a thread in waiting or sleeping state, sets the interrupt call
- isInterrupted(): checks the interrupted flag of the target thread
- interrupted(): static method that checks the current thread interrupt flag and clears it.
- isAlive(): checks the running status of the thread("true" if thread is started and "false" if the thread is terminated)
- getName(): returns the name of the thread
- setName(): sets the name of the thread
- getPriority(): gets the priority of the thread
- setPriority(): sets the priority of the thread (min_priority: 1 to max_priority: 10)
- currentThread(): returns a reference to the currently running thread
- getState(): returns the current state of the thread (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED)
- holdsLock(Object obj): checks if the current thread holds a lock on the given object
- yield(): temporarily pause the execution of the current thread to allow for other threads to execute



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN start, run, sleep, wait, join

start: creates a new thread and calls run method implicitly.
run: run method contains the code that needs to be executed inside a thread
sleep: pauses the execution of a thread for a set period of time
wait: stops the execution of the thread, release lock and make that thread wait until another thread notifies it
join: makes the called thread wait for the execution of target thread



Object class methods:

- wait(): causes the current thread to wait indefinitely
        until another thread call notify() or notifyAll() and releases lock
- wait(long timeout): causes the thread to wait for specified time(milliseconds) and release lock
- wait(long timeout, int nanos): similar to previous but added precision of nanoseconds
- notify(): wakes up or notifies only one thread that is currently waiting for the lock(the thread is chosen by JVM randomly).
    - the thread that was notified does not run immediately it moves from waiting to blocked state and waits until it can get the lock
    - must be called on the synchronized block or synchronized methods on the same object.
- notifyAll(): notifies all threads that are in the waiting state and moves them to blocked state
    - blocked threads wait for lock and only one thread at a time can get the lock and execute
    - must be used inside synchronized block or synchronized method
