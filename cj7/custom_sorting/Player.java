// Comparable interface is used to define the natural order of the objects of a class
// defines how the objects of same class should be ordered
// override the compareTo method to implement the custom order logic
// the return type is int
// -1 if this object is less than the other object
// 0 if both are equal
// 1 if this object is naturally greater than the other object
// in case of comparable we can only have one sorting order logic
